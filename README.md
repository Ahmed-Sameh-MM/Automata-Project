# Automata & Compatibility Project

## Dependencies
```python
from PyQt5 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets
from PyQt5.uic import loadUi
import pydot
import os
from collections import defaultdict
import graphviz
import atexit
import copy
import re
```

## Running Program
```
Running the program can be done by opening MrAutoMaton.exe executable file found in the EXE folder
```

## [Part 1]
```
Write a report on how the Turing machine and Pushdown automata are used in the computation models.

The report should also include:
	• its implementations
	• its advantages and disadvantages
	• the problems it solves or over come
	• its shortages and drawbacks
	• any extra knowledge
```

## [Part 2]
```
1- A Python program to:
	 1- convert any non-deterministic finite automaton to deterministic finite automaton
	 2- convert context free grammar to Pushdown automaton
2- A Documentation for the program with screenshots of the output
```
